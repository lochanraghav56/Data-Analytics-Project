This project addresses the challenges of inaccurate consignment measurements in e-commerce logistics, specifically focusing on the first-mile pickup process. Accurate weight and dimension data are crucial for efficient logistics operations, and this project aims to minimize discrepancies between declared and actual measurements. 

## Project Description

E-commerce companies in India handle a vast number of deliveries across numerous pin codes, making precise consignment measurements essential. This project tackles the issue of mismatches in consignment measurements, which can lead to billing disputes, delays, and inefficiencies. The solution involves developing a system that integrates digital measuring devices, automated barcode scanning, and real-time validation to ensure accuracy at the pickup stage. 

## Key Objectives

* To explore and analyze the logistics and consignment management process in e-commerce. 
* To focus on the entire lifecycle of consignments, including order processing, documentation, tracking, and packaging. 
* To examine the first-mile, middle-mile, and last-mile delivery operations. 
* To optimize logistics networks for speed, reliability, and cost efficiency. 

## Scope

* Covers the entire logistics and supply chain process in e-commerce. 
* Examines consignment movement from supplier/manufacturer to the final customer. 
* Investigates operational phases (first-mile, middle-mile, last-mile delivery). 
* Delves into the role of technology (real-time tracking, warehouse management, analytics). 
* Addresses challenges like regional disparities and supply chain disruptions. 

## Methodology

The project followed a systematic approach: 

1.  **Research and Data Collection:** Gathering data from case studies, reports, and articles. 
2.  **Analysis of Consignment Process:** Mapping the consignment lifecycle. 
3.  **Study of Operational Phases:** Analyzing first-mile, middle-mile, and last-mile stages. 
4.  **Packaging and Handling Review:** Examining packaging protocols and tracking systems. 
5.  **Technology and Systems Integration:** Exploring the use of real-time tracking and warehouse management systems. 
6.  **Challenges and Solutions:** Identifying logistics challenges and potential solutions. 
7.  **Conclusion and Recommendations:** Summarizing findings and providing recommendations for improvement. 

## System Requirements

##   Code and Implementation

The project includes SQL scripts for data pre-processing, data exploration, outlier detection, and logic building for anomaly detection. 

* Data pre-processing steps involve unit conversions and volume calculations. 
* Exploratory data analysis includes industry and client-level CFT analysis. 
* Outlier detection is performed using the IQR method. 
* Logic is implemented to detect weight vs. volume mismatches and density outliers. 

##   Data Flow Diagrams

The repository also contains Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) illustrating the system's processes: 

* 0 Level DFD: Shows the system as a single process interacting with external entities (customers, sellers, delivery partners, admins). 
* 1 Level DFD: Breaks down the system into major sub-processes (order processing, consignment management, tracking, delivery management). 
* 2 Level DFD: Provides detailed views of specific processes (order validation, consignment scheduling, real-time tracking, delivery status updates).
